# Demographics Chart Fix Documentation

## Issue Fixed

The "Sales Distribution by Gender and Age" chart in the demographics page was not rendering properly. Specifically, the chart wasn't starting from zero dollars ($0) on the y-axis, which led to potentially misleading visualizations.

## Changes Made

1. **Y-axis Configuration**:
   - Added `beginAtZero: true` and `min: 0` to the y-axis configuration to force the chart to start from zero
   - This ensures that sales comparisons are visually accurate

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Added proper validation for data values with `typeof val === 'number' ? val : 0`
   - Implemented handling for when no data is available for a period

3. **Format Improvements**:
   - Enhanced display of dollar values with proper currency symbols and commas
   - Added tooltips with improved formatting for better user experience

4. **Styling Enhancements**:
   - Added proper title and axis labels
   - Improved color scheme for better accessibility
   - Added responsive options for better display on different devices

## Verification Files

The following files were created to verify the fixes:

1. `verify_chart_fix.py`: Creates a standalone test page that loads data from the API and verifies that the chart now starts from zero
   - Run with: `./verify_chart_fix.py`
   - Generated test HTML file allows toggling between zero-base and auto-scaling to see the difference

2. `open_demographics_page.py`: Opens the actual demographics page in a browser to verify the fix in the context of the real application
   - Run with: `./open_demographics_page.py`

3. `test_demographics_chart.py`: Original test script that creates a test HTML file showing the fixed chart
   - Run with: `python test_demographics_chart.py`

## Testing Performed

- Verified that the y-axis starts from zero dollars ($0) as required
- Tested with different time periods (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y, all) to ensure consistent behavior
- Verified proper display of currency values in tooltips
- Tested responsiveness on different screen sizes
- Verified proper handling of null/empty data scenarios

## Additional Notes

- The fix preserves all previous functionality while improving the visual accuracy of the chart
- The chart scales proportionally based on data values but always starts from zero
- Implementation uses Chart.js best practices for financial data visualization
- The grid lines and ticks are properly aligned with currency values
- Cross-browser compatibility has been tested

## How to Run Verification

```bash
# To verify the fix with a standalone test page
cd /home/s010p/SWE_DB_Project/DashAnalytics
./verify_chart_fix.py

# To view the actual demographics page with the fix
cd /home/s010p/SWE_DB_Project/DashAnalytics
./open_demographics_page.py
```
