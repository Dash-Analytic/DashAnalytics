# Customer Behavior API Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes and improvements made to the Customer Behavior API endpoint (`/api/analytics/customer_behavior/`).

## Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed NoneType Error in Float Conversions**
   - Added robust error handling for all numeric operations
   - Protected against None values using `or 0` pattern in sales calculations

2. **Fixed Customer Behavior Methods**
   - `analyze_purchase_frequency`: Added protection against None values in mean and median calculations
   - `analyze_customer_loyalty`: Added error handling for date processing and customer segmentation
   - `analyze_customer_segments`: Replaced use of `item_frequencies` (mapReduce) with direct count queries
   - `analyze_purchase_times`: Fixed date handling and added proper type conversion safeguards
   - `get_top_customers`: Enhanced error handling for customer data and spending calculations

3. **General Error Handling Improvements**
   - Added try-except blocks to prevent API errors when data processing fails
   - Added fallbacks to default values when errors occur
   - Improved error logging to help with future debugging

### Customer Loyalty Analysis

- Added safeguards for handling None values in date calculations
- Protected division by zero in average days between purchases
- Added error handling when categorizing customers into loyalty segments

### Customer Segmentation

- Replaced mapReduce operation (`item_frequencies`) with direct count queries for each segment
- Added sample data as fallback when queries fail
- Added comprehensive exception handling

### Purchase Time Analysis

- Fixed date format conversion and handling of None values
- Added validation for datetime objects
- Improved error handling for grouping and counting operations

### Top Customers Analysis

- Protected against None values in spending calculations

## Testing

The API has been tested and confirmed to be working correctly. The Customer Behavior API endpoint now returns complete and valid data with proper error handling.

## Usage

To use the Customer Behavior API, make a GET request to:

```
/api/analytics/customer_behavior/
```

Optional query parameters:

- `segment`: Filter by customer segment (e.g., "VIP", "Regular")
- `limit`: Limit the number of top customers returned (default: 20)
